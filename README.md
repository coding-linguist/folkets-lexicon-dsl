# folkets-lexikon-dsl
## DESCRIPTION

DSL versions of the English-Swedish & Swedish-English People's dictionary available at http://folkets-lexikon.csc.kth.se/

### REQUIREMENTS

You need to have already installed a dictionary application which is compatible with the DSL format, such as: 
* Goldendict for Windows, Mac, Linux or Android  (http://goldendict.org/)
* Dictionary Universal for iOS (http://dictionary-universal.appspot.com/dictionary/en/)
* Alpus (formerly Fora) for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS (http://ng-comp.com/alpus/index.html)

### INSTALLATION

Download SV_EN_Folkets.zip and/or EN_SV_Folkets.zip from https://github.com/coding-linguist/folkets-lexikon-dsl/releases and install them according to your chosen application's instructions.

In general, for Goldendict you need to decompress the .zip file and copy it to your dictionaries folder (that's the GoldenDict folder on Android). For Dictionary Universal and Alpus you'll need to import the .zip file itself.

### CONTRIBUTE

The perl commands used for generating the dictionaries can be found inside the dev branch. They are no longer maintained, but feel free to use them as a reference.
